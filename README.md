A selection of the more interesting scripts prepared for my research project and a workshop I taught on Python and the Raspberry Pi.

We designed a plug and play DAQ using the Raspberry Pi, with support for Bluetooth, local Wifi, and internet data transfer.

The workshop tasked the students with creating a weather console, which displays real-time weather data and radar alongside an elevation map for a zip code.  We used the National Map website's LIDAR datasets and the Beautiful Soup library to create a simple desktop app.
